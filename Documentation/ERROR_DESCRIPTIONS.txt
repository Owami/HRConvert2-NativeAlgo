COPYRIGHT INFORMATION ...
HRConvert2, Copyright on 6/9/2024 by Justin Grimes, www.github.com/zelon88

LICENSE INFORMATION ...
This project is protected by the GNU GPLv3 Open-Source license.
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html

APPLICATION INFORMATION ...
This application is designed to provide a web-interface for converting file formats on a server for users of any web browser without authentication. 

FILE INFORMATION ...
v3.3.7
This plain text file contains descriptions of all the native error messages contained in or produced by the HRConvert2 Diablo engine. 
These descriptions should give administrators a starting point for debugging problems with HRConvert2 installations. 
Each section in this file contains information about a different error message. The first one is an example to demonstrate the structure of this file.
Details about each section are below.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS ... 
This application requires at least a Raspberry Pi Model B+ or greater. 
This application will run on just about any x86 or x64 computer.

DEPENDENCY REQUIREMENTS ... 
This application requires Debian Linux (w/3rd Party audio license), Apache 2.4, PHP 8+, LibreOffice, Unoconv, ClamAV, Tesseract, Rar, Unrar, Unzip, 7zipper, 
Ffmpeg, PdfToText, Dia, PopplerUtils, MeshLab, Mkisofs & ImageMagick.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
HRConvert2 logs information about it's operational activity to the Logs subdirectory where HRConvert2 is installed by default.
The default logging directory can be adjusted by modifying the --Log Storage Directory-- section of the config.php file. 
Log entries that represent normal, expected behavior begin with 'OP-Act:' to signify "Operational Activity".
Log entries that represent abnormal behavior begin with 'ERROR'.
If a log file does not exist; HRConvert2 will attempt to create one. 
If an attempt to create a log file or write log entries fails for any reason; HRConvert2 will output errors directly to the page instead. 
If a log file exists, was created on the current date, and is smaller than the "Maximum Log File Size" in config.php; HRConvert2 will append log entries to it. 
Once the "Maximum Log File Size" specified in config.php has been reached; HRConvert2 will create a new log file with a numerically incremented file name.
Actual maximum log file size will vary slightly from the "Maximum Log File Size" because it must be exceeded before HRConvert2 will replace it. 
Typically the "Maximum Log File Size" is only exceeded by a small number of bytes.
Time will be ommitted from logs in situations where time has not been initialized yet.
The application name will be replaced with 'HRConvert2' from errors in situations where the config.php file has not been initialized yet. 
The log number will be replaced with '###' in the event that the error number supplied by the calling code was invalid.
If "Enhanced Logging Verbosity" is enabled in config.php; all significant core operations will produce a log entry.
If "Enhanced Logging Verbosity" is disabled in config.php; only warnings and errors during core operations will produce a log entry.
