-----PREFACE-----
For this guide, it is assumed that the user is installing HRConvert2 on a PC which meets the above conditions.
This document contains instructions for building an HRConvert2 Docker Image on a fresh deployment of Lubuntu 21.04 LTS with no dependencies. 

For a walkthrough of installing a Ubuntu distro, visit:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----STEP 0 - ARE YOU IN THE RIGHT PLACE?-----
In this step we will make sure your use case aligns with the purpose of this document.
It is not necessary to perform the steps in this document to simply install and use the official HRConvert2 Docker Image.
This document is intended to be used for development purposes by HRConvert2 maintainers.

If you simply want to download and run HRConvert2, you can download the official pre-built docker image at the following URL.
  https://hub.docker.com/r/zelon88/hrconvert2

Usually people who want to run the official Docker image are people who;
  1. Want to use HRConvert2 for personal, industrial, educational, non-profit, or commercial use on a small number of servers.
  2. Want to run the most stable, secure, & up-to-date version of HRConvert2 that is available.
  3. Just want to convert files.
  4. Are not planning on contributing to development.
  5. Are not planning on modifying the code or dependencies.

Usually people who want to build their own Docker Image from source are people who;
  1. Have modified the code or dependencies, and want to share the changes or deploy them on many servers.
  2. Have a custom configuration that needs to be deployed on many servers.
  3. Are contributing to a branch of HRConvert2 for distribution.

If you truly want to build your own Docker Image from source this document will guide you through the Docker Image Build Instructions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-----STEP 1 - PREPARE THE FILES-----
1. Grab a cup of coffee.
2. Make sure you have Docker installed. Run  'sudo apt-get install docker.io'
3. Update the Dockerfile located at /var/www/html/HRProprietary/HRConvert2/Documentation/Build/Dockerfile.
4. Complete the source code update of HRConvert2 and upload it to the Github repo.
  4a. Note that the repo is the official source code location for the Dockerfile.
  4b. The source you copy over with the docker file is for reference only, and IS NOT USED to generate the image.
  4c. The source code used to generate the image comes from the Github repo specified in the Dockerfile.
5. Navigate to /var/www/html/HRProprietary/HRConvert2 and copy all folders EXCEPT Logs and DATA.
6. Paste the folders onto into a folder on the Desktop.
  6a. Note that the source code contained in these files is mostly unused. 
  6b. The Dockerfile creates a container that downloads the source code from the Github repo.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----STEP 2 - BUILD THE DOCKER IMAGE-----
1. Before building, ALWAYS restart the Docker service. Doing so resolves countless errors.
  1a. Run  'sudo service docker restart'
  1b. Run  'sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart'
  1c. Run  'sudo snap restart docker'
2. Before building, make sure you've updated the Github repo specified in the Dockerfile
  2a. If you don't update the Github repo, you will build old source code.
3. Next, select one of the build commands below based on your specific use case.
  3a. To run a full, clean build; Navigate to the Desktop/HRConvert2 folder, then adjust the version & run  'docker build --no-cache -t zelon88/hrconvert2:v#.#.# .'
  3b. To run an build from the last successful step; Navigate to the Desktop/HRConvert2 folder, then adjust the version & run  'docker build -t zelon88/hrconvert2:v#.#.# .'
  3c. To regenerate the sources.list file, uncomment the dockerfile line '#RUN rm -vf /var/lib/apt/lists/*', then run  'docker build -t hrconvert2 .'
4. Grab another cup of coffee. The build process will take some time. 
  4a. For my 16C, 64GB server it takes about 1,500 seconds (25 minutes) to build the Docker Image from scratch.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----STEP 3 - TEST THE DOCKER IMAGE-----

1. Run  'docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 zelon88/hrconvert2:v#.#.#'
2. Open a browser and navigate to ' http://localhost:8080' to test the converter.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----STEP 4 - PUSH THE DOCKER IMAGE TO DOCKER HUB-----

1. On a computer with Docker Hub account linked, modify the version number in the following command, then run  'docker push zelon88/hrconvert2:v#.#.#'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----NOTES-----

1. If you forget to tag your release, don't re-build it! Use the following procedure to add the missing tags.
  1a. Run  'docker images'
  1b. Copy the Image ID of the Docker Image you want to tag.
  1c. Add a new tag to the existing image by running  'docker tag ########### zelon88/hrconvert2:v#.#.#'  where ##### is the Image ID and v#.#.# is the version being tagged.
  1d. To remove a tag, run  'docker rmi zelon88/hrconvert2:v#.#.#'
2. Adding the  'latest'  tag is helpful to users.
3. Building the Docker Image from source will take at least 25 minutes on a high performance server.
